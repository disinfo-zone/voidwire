    <h2>Transmission</h2>
    <p>
      VOIDWIRE is a daily dispatch from the celestial wire -- an automated reading
      of planetary positions, lunar phases, and astronomical transits, rendered into
      prose by machine intelligence and delivered each day at the threshold between
      night and morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each reading is generated from precise ephemeris calculations, interpreting the
      geometry of the solar system as it appears from Earth. The positions are real.
      The aspects are exact. The language is synthetic.
    </p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      This project sits at the intersection of ancient pattern-recognition and
      modern computation. The sky has been read for millennia. VOIDWIRE simply
      automates the observation, stripping away human bias while preserving the
      structure of the interpretive tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      No claims are made about causality or influence. The transmissions are
      literary artifacts shaped by astronomical data -- nothing more, nothing less.
    </p>

    <h2>Typography &amp; Design</h2>
    <p>
      The site is set in EB Garamond, a revival of Claude Garamont's sixteenth-century
      type. The choice is deliberate: a typeface designed for sustained reading,
      rooted in the same era that produced the first printed ephemerides and
      astronomical tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The void-black background eliminates distraction. Text is rendered in muted
      parchment tones -- warm enough to read comfortably, dim enough to feel like
      reading by candlelight. The design prioritizes the word above all else.
    </p>

    <h2>Colophon</h2>
    <p>
      Built with Astro and Svelte. Ephemeris calculations via Swiss Ephemeris.
      Served from the void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source is the sky. The medium is the wire. The rest is noise.
